Plot Items:

Plot items includes power cells, keycards and other things which are necessary for progression.

Keycards are usually not moved if it makes sense not to - for isntance, Grassi has the keycard for the Crew Quarters (as specified by Polito), so this isn't changed. Instead his body is moved.
