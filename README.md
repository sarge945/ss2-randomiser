# SS2 Randomiser
A DML based randomiser for System Shock 2.

For more information, please see the System Shock Modifications Archive thread [here](https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=12152)

Packaged releases are usually posted on the forum thread. This repo exists as a backup, and as somewhere for anyone interested to grab my source files.

## Info for Modders

This mod was made using [makedml](https://github.com/tunbridgep/ss2-makedml). This means the DML files are split into multiple different files.

If you wish to make your own build (say, without plot items randomised), you can do so by downloading the archive, deleting the relevant folder in **src/**, and then building using makedml.
